# SimIO

Programmable Input Emulator for C#. It's a simulation enthusiast's utility similar to [FreePIE](https://andersmalmgren.github.io/FreePIE/) and [GlovePIE](https://github.com/Ravbug/GlovePIE) but for C#. 

## Features
Can read input from Keyboard, mouse or HID compatible devices via Rawinput and write Keyboard, mouse and joystick input using SendInput and vJoy.

## Limitations and requirements
 * Only works on Windows x64 platform.
 * [vJoy](http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net/joomla/) must be installed on the system.
 * Unlike GlovePIE and FreePIE SimIO does not provide any user interface or editor.
